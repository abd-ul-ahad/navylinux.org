#### How to contribute to the Navy Linux project?

This project in which we have covered ourselves is of a gigantic size, and the result is going to be quite good, but to make it possible we need a very large team to work on it.

All skills are welcome. Programmers, IT, sys-admin, designers, advertisers, all roles are welcome.

If you want to participate in the project, we invite you to join our Slack channel, which is our main means of communication. From here you can get in touch with the people who manage the project to find out more details and study how you can contribute to the project.

Thanks you.
