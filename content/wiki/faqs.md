### Question and Answer

##### How many people are currently working or collaborating on the project?
* Currently, our Slack Channel has 80+ members who contribute to various aspects of the development process. The core team is managed by a team of 4. 

##### What experience do these people have in other developments or projects?
* True to the open-source ethos, the people contributing to NavyLinux come from different specialties and disciplines. What unites us is the focus on community-driven development and upkeep, forever.

##### What relationship did they have with CentOS in their professional life?
* All of us use CentOS in our real life. Some, because their company relies on it, others use it for their study use cases. But, the majority of us use CentOS for our personal projects and labs.

##### What role do your sponsors play?
* Today we have three sponsors who offer their services.
    * [Mozemo](https://mozemo.net/) is supplying us with VPS servers for our different type of software, they also help us with implementation, setup, configuration regarding our infrastructure and they also contribute to our marketing with ideas, future plans, and ads.
    * [Siteage](https://www.siteage.net/) is also a provider of VPS services and helps with the configuration of software.
    * [Hackernoon](https://hackernoon.com/), a tech publication, helps us with free advertising on their website

##### How did the idea of ​​creating an alternative to the doomed CentOS Linux come about?
* CentOS's sudden shift of direction made us realize that such pivots and shifts will continue to affect vast numbers of people unless somebody stepped up and made us less reliant on outside forces. This was the foundational basis of NavyLinux.

##### How will Navy Linux be alike and different from CentOS? Is it simply a replica?
* Navy Linux will be 100% RHEL. Except, we're focussing on a minimalistic installation-type build and that the community voted to build a CentOS like experience for the users.

##### Do you plan to go beyond what was CentOS?
* We will see. Right now, the first goal is to openly develop a CentOS-like server-side operating system before December 31, 2021.

##### Are there already interested in using your solution?
* CentOS's shift, as discussed above, affected a vast number of people. This naturally led to several members of its erstwhile community to attempt to build a suitable replacement. We're doing the same. This is the beauty of open source.

##### At what level of development is Navy Linux? When do you estimate to be able to launch a stable version?
* We are just getting started. The team is not huge and there is no ETA yet, but we want to make an official release of NavyLinux before the CentOS EOL.
