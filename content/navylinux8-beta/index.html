<h1>Navy Linux 8 Beta is here!</h1>
<p>After so much work we have our first beta available for anyone who wants to try this new distribution that the Navy Linux team is building. We are very grateful that you tried it and let us know how your experience with it has been, since we want this to be a real alternative to centOS, and this would not be possible without your help. Thank you very much, here below we leave the download links.</p>
